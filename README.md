## About
DRONESWAP is a hardware hack project made at Hackster.io in Boston - May 2015. The objective is to create a system for drones to quickly swap out their batteries so that they don't get tied down by long charging periods. This can provide a way for autonomous drones to deliver packages long-distance among other applications.
